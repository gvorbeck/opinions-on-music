      I like to make lists and I like to listen to music. Not always at the same time. Here are my

      This website serves as a portfolio project that demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of
      Vue.js. It features an extensive use of components, props, data handling, computed properties,
      methods, watchers, event emitters, API integrations, and lifecycle hooks. Additionally, the
      project leverages TypeScript and Tailwind CSS for robust and scalable development. Integration
      with the Last.fm API showcases real-time data fetching and manipulation. Explore the source
      code on <a href="https://github.com/gvorbeck/opinions-on-music" target="_blank">GitHub</a> to
      learn more about the implementation and to view the codebase.
